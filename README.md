#### Install requirements
python 3.6.7 was used, not sure which versions are supported
To use python 2.7 minor tweeks to the code have to be made

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.6+.

Run the following to install requirements for the project.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### The different project
Tank_Q-learning is one tank which utilizes model free, value based aproximator with TD(0), default is set with gamme equals 0 so technically is not a q-learning with gamme=0, feel free to change the parameters.

#### Alter Parameter
To alter parameters change the values in python file params.py
